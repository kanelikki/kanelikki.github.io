in a forest
on a street
in a city
in a field
in the sky
in the space
in the beach
on the sea
under the sea
underground
on the ocean
in the lawn
in a rainbow
in a mountain
on a hill
on a river
on a lake
on a frozen lake
in the garden
in the kitchen
in rain
in snow
in the desert
in the dream
in a room
in a supermarket
in someone's backyard
in your house
in the toilet
in the office
in a bar
in a caf√©
in a restraunt
on a road
on a crossroad
in a beautiful sunset
in a beautiful sunrise
on a cliff
on a playground
in a castle
in a valley
in a square
in mars
in the dark
in a park
in a bench
on a chair
in bushes
in a cave
in a dungeon
in a field
on a swamp
in a egloo
in a graveyard
in a jail
in a maze
on a chair
on a bench
in the heaven
in the hell
