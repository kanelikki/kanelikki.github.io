   <h1>Artists, are you mad at AI?</h1> 
   <content>
       <p>Many artists don't like AI drawing, and don't call it as art. Part of artists have fear about AI taking their job.</p>
       <p>Blame the advertisements, all they say is "AI is magic", but magic is heresy. Don't fall into them.</p>
       <p>And yes I don't like the stupid marketing.</p>
       <h2>But why are you upset?</h2>
       <h3>They steal art style.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                First, they need a lot of training model for stealing art. Second, the model should know what is your art style.
                You have to be famous, and very successful artist first.<br>
                If you are mad on the famous artists' side, they are famous enough, so will be paid for proper art anyway.
            </li>
            <li>
                Human also can copy, or being affected by others' art style. AI also learns like human, but they learn really fast, and in different way.
            </li>
            <li>
                Their style has limit, and they may not give exactly what you want. This will be discussed later.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lastly, artists are human, they cannot live forever, thus cannot draw forever.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>....With just few words.</h3>
            <p>It's very unlikely to get that good result that easily.</p>
            <p>AI still throws goofy results often. People do <b>trial and error</b>, add negative prompt word again and again to produce the final result.</p>
            <p>Yes, there are tons of abandon odd result behind some good shots. You need luck.</p>
            <p>Of course, for bad quality, few words are enough, but as an artist, you won't compete with them, right?</p>
            <p>So Not yet.</p>
            <p>Or, even if the AI generated drawing becomes better, still no.</p>
            <p>Few words are not enough to get what clients exactly want, either AI or human artist.</p>
            <p>Yes, the few word magic is myth, and will be myth in the future.</p>
            <p>Also, some people say choosing right word isn't a skill.</p>
            <p>The truth is, even Googling is skill, even the Googling requires literally few words (significally less than proper AI input).</p>
            <p>Knowing what you want, asking what you want is skill. It's called communication skill.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.neermcd.com/newsworthy/de-minimis-standard-in-ai-generated-art-copyright-board-rejects-thtre-dopra-spatial-without-disclaimer" >From this</a>, for example, it says</p><blockquote cite="https://www.neermcd.com/newsworthy/de-minimis-standard-in-ai-generated-art-copyright-board-rejects-thtre-dopra-spatial-without-disclaimer">The artwork at issue was created by Jason Allen using Midjourney with <b>at least 624 revisions/text prompts</b>, then other tools for further editing</blockquote>
<p>So, how 624 or more revisions and prompts can be just few words? Is this what you saying?</p>
        <h3>They are taking our job!</h3>
            <p>Or you may say "nobody will want our art because every AI drawing is available in public"</p>
            <p>Of course, company want ther own drawing, and also as private, so can release the art with product.</p>
            <p>Technology grows fast, and client request grows aswell.</p>
            <p>But if you are planning to sell your art without specific client request, I have bad news.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>If it still looks easy, why don't you try by yourself?</p>

            <p></p>
        <h2>Will AI take the artist job?</h2>
            <p>Yes and no.</p>
            <p>Historically, photograph affected art style - people drew less realistic art.</p>
            <p>But in the end, artists changed their art style.</p>
            <p>At this point, you may think, 'but AI can make anything', but not really.</p>
            <p>AI has limitations, so you can hit the AI's weak spot, or use AI as compliment tool, and you will be okay.</p>

        <h2>Face and learn about AI</h2>
            <p>AI reads and makes image very differently from human.</p>
            <p>They use noise profile for understanding and generating the image.</p>
            <p>Human cannot catch that noise - even the small noise change can break AI image recognition.</p>
            <p>If this is still complicated, just remember their basic learning style is different from human.</p>
            <p>The AI can catch the whole style, but their weak point is detail (and good negative prompts may or may not fix the issue).</p>

            <h3>So what is the strength and limitation of the AI?</h3>
                <p>AI is good with photorealistic images, close-up images of one object, and landscapes.</p>
                <p>Currently they aren't that good with anime details, but not bad either if you don't care of the details.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Then, what kind of art job AI cannot take (currently)?</p>
                <p>Think of some images that are bad as JPEG format.</p>
                <p>This says, if you are vector, pixel or UI artist, you are safe (at least now).</p>
                <p>Also, AI is bad with making creative infamous character (I mean, like Patapon), since the source to learn is not enough for AI.</p>
                <p>If you make creative character concept, don't worry about the AI.</p>
                <p>(This doesn't count human-like character, unfortunately. Only unique shaped characters are counted.)</p>
                <p>Here is another suggestion. Don't limit art to only result of drawing. You can share the amazing progreess of drawing.</p>
                <p>Last but not least, have good communication skill with human.</p>
                <p>Really, in real business, clients want to review and fix detail - tools are growing, so does request, that always happened.</p>
                <p>If you can understand client request a lot better than AI, the client will have good reason to chose you instead of the AI.</p>

            <h3>How about using AI as a tool?</h3>
                <p>The one way, but artists don't like, is drawing or editing on AI generated drawing.</p>
                <p>This saves time to draw, so it is effective way, but unfortunately, you may not claim copyright, since it is considered as AI work.</p>
                <p>Then, how about this?</p>
                <p>AI can help with your inspiration.</p>
                <p>For example, imagine a car after 100 years, and you have no idea about that. AI can suggest how does it look like.</p>
                <p>You can draw based on the 'hint' of the AI.</p>
                <p>AI always generates image, even in the scenario that human cannot answer.</p>
           <h4>Society is not ready for this right now.</h4>
<p>Since major artists are against AI drawing, like you, using AI as tool is unaccepted.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, companies don't respect artists' work based on AI, because AI is trending. "AI made it" promotion works better than mentioning artists behind.</p>

        <h2>OK so? AI drawing isn't an art.</h2>
            <p>Considering people also learn from people, AI is a just an artist who is genius with learning.</p>
            <p>Of course people ask to copy artists' style, and this may not considered as art.</p>
            <p>But people usually mix more than one art styles to prompt. The result style can be unique.</p>
            <p>If you tell to copy one artwork and nothing else, it isn't art.</p>
            <p>If you tell to combinate styles, and add your imagination to prompt, it is whole new work, thus it is art.</p>
            <p>Also, for input prompt, considering creative writing, it is art.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>See, AI is not that as good as you think. But don't stay on your place. They are growing fast.</p>
            <p>Historically, machine and IT replaced human's part of work, and as a result, the whole job structure has been changed.</p>
            <p>It's not only artist, AI is changing the whole job market.</p>
            <p>But one thing is sure, art is about creativity, after all. Find your strength that AI cannot follow.</p>
            <p>Embrace AI's difference, learn different style, and make your own way. They just exist, and there's no point to be angry towards them.</p>
            <p>AI images will be different genre of 'art'. Denying them will be gatekeeping eventually.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Also remember, companies exaggerate AI because it is marketing that makes money.</p>
        <h2>Side note</h2>
            <p>Look, you really don't have to worry, in our case, web developing got new trend even Wordpress and other tools took the website creating job.</p>
            <p>There is always new way. Use your creativity.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Or if you are hobbyist, just enjoy the whole progress. AI's existence doesn't mean you have to stop creating.</p>

       <p>This article exists for correcting some misconceptions towards AI generated images (and I am pretty sure other people wrote this kind of article too).</p>
       <p>If you are still mad with this article, whatever, I don't care at that point.</p>
       <p>Contributing to this article is welcomed :D</p>
       <p></p>
       <p>(maybe I'll add some images someday or idk)</p>
